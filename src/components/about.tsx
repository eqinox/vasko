      Hi there, my name is Vasil Nikolov, a Software Engineer based in Sofia
      Bulgaria.
      <br />
      <br />
      I have worked with various programming languages and have chosen to
      specialize in JavaScript. I like to delve into the problems and solve
      complex tasks, as a whole I am a strategist and like to think about the
      solutions. Harder it is, more interested I am.
      <br />
      <br />
      My goal is to create a seamless and engaging user experience, not only for
      the users who interact with the applications I develop but also for the
      clients I collaborate with. I strive to build intuitive, efficient, and
      accessible web solutions that meet both business needs and user
      expectations, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for everyone
      involved.
      <br />
